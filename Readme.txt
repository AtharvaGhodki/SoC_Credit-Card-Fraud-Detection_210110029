Hello!, This is Atharva Ghodki from MEMS Department. This project is about Credit Card Fraud Detection by Using 
MACHINE LEARNING (ML) and DS.
* I had done my whole coding work in Google Collab and I had attached its file named "Credit_Card.ipynb".

*IMP--> Please use 'creditcard.csv' file and make change in code by replacing "drive/MyDrive/creditcard.csv" to
 to ".../creditcard.csv" where '...' represent your location of storage of thar file in your Drive. 

* I have worked over this project in 3 phases as below--
  1. Learning Python and its IMP Libraries.
  2. Learning all about basic ML up to Classifiers (Logistic Regression).
  3. Working over Data set given by the mentor and solving questions of its.

Phases Description--->

* Phase 1--> 1.Here I learn all the basic python required for this project along with its important libraries
  like Numpy,Pandas,Seaborn, Matplotlib ,Sklearn(basic).
 
* Phase 2--> In this I learn basic ML use for this project from videos and references given by my mentor.
  Along withthis I start exploring its external uses and applications and self-search references to know 
  details about maths use here.

* Phase 3--> This was an important phase of my project. Here, I implement all skills I learn in Phases 1 and 2.
  I code all the required questions and try to predict Fraud detection using various models like Regression
  model, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees with Python implementation, Random Forest with Python 
  implementation, XGBoost with Python implementation. This was full of application-based phases.

At last, I was thankful to my mentor who guide me and provide nice material for this project.
And yes I enjoy to work during this project :)
